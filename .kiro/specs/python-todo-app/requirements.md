# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a console-based Todo application in Python that follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. The application will provide CRUD operations for todo items, support switchable persistence backends (JSON and XML), and feature a rich console interface with comprehensive test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new todo items so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "Add Todo" option THEN the system SHALL prompt me for title, description, and due date
2. WHEN I provide valid todo information THEN the system SHALL create a new todo item with a unique ID
3. WHEN I provide invalid information THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and allow me to retry
4. WHEN a todo is created THEN the system SHALL save it to the selected persistence backend
5. WHEN a todo is created THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the todo details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my todo items so that I can see what tasks I have pending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "List Todos" option THEN the system SHALL display all todo items in a formatted table
2. WHEN there are no todos THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the list is empty
3. WHEN displaying todos THEN the system SHALL show ID, title, description, due date, and completion status
4. WHEN displaying todos THEN the system SHALL use color coding to distinguish completed from pending items
5. WHEN displaying todos THEN the system SHALL sort items by due date with overdue items highlighted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update existing todo items so that I can modify task details as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "Update Todo" option THEN the system SHALL prompt me for the todo ID to update
2. WHEN I provide a valid todo ID THEN the system SHALL display current values and allow editing
3. WHEN I provide an invalid todo ID THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN I update todo fields THEN the system SHALL validate the new information
5. WHEN updates are valid THEN the system SHALL save changes and display a success message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as completed so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "Complete Todo" option THEN the system SHALL prompt me for the todo ID
2. WHEN I provide a valid todo ID THEN the system SHALL mark the item as completed
3. WHEN I provide an invalid todo ID THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a todo is marked complete THEN the system SHALL update the persistence backend
5. WHEN a todo is marked complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select the "Delete Todo" option THEN the system SHALL prompt me for the todo ID
2. WHEN I provide a valid todo ID THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before deletion
3. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the todo from the persistence backend
4. WHEN I provide an invalid todo ID THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different storage formats so that I can choose how my data is persisted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN the system SHALL allow me to choose between JSON and XML storage
2. WHEN I select a storage format THEN the system SHALL use that format for all persistence operations
3. WHEN switching storage formats THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
4. WHEN using JSON storage THEN the system SHALL save data in valid JSON format
5. WHEN using XML storage THEN the system SHALL save data in valid XML format

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can ensure code quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% code coverage
2. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL follow TDD with failing tests first
3. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently
4. WHEN testing domain models THEN validation rules SHALL be thoroughly tested
5. WHEN testing repositories THEN both JSON and XML persistence SHALL be tested

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean architecture with DDD principles so that the code is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL have distinct domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers
2. WHEN domain models are defined THEN they SHALL use Pydantic v2 for validation
3. WHEN repositories are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the repository pattern with interfaces
4. WHEN services are implemented THEN they SHALL coordinate between domain and infrastructure layers
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection principles

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive console interface so that I can easily interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN the system SHALL display a clear menu of options
2. WHEN I interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL use rich formatting and colors
3. WHEN I provide input THEN the system SHALL validate and provide clear feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL return to the main menu

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code quality tools integrated so that the codebase maintains high standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN Ruff SHALL be used for linting and formatting
2. WHEN source code is analyzed THEN Mypy SHALL perform static type checking
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN uv package manager SHALL be used
4. WHEN tests are excluded from type checking THEN Mypy SHALL only analyze source code
5. WHEN code quality checks run THEN they SHALL pass without errors
