# Implementation Plan

## Development Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Follow GitHub conventional branch naming with prefixes:
  - `feat/` for new features (e.g., `feat/project-setup`, `feat/domain-layer`)
  - `docs/` for documentation updates (e.g., `docs/readme-update`, `docs/api-documentation`)
  - `test/` for test-related changes (e.g., `test/coverage-improvement`, `test/integration-tests`)
  - `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/validation-error`, `fix/persistence-issue`)
  - `refactor/` for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/repository-pattern`)
  - `chore/` for maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/dependency-update`, `chore/ci-setup`)
- **Commit Strategy**: Use conventional commits with descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: add TodoItem model with validation`, `test: add unit tests for repository layer`)
- **Task Execution**: Wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next main task to ensure quality and allow for review
- **Testing**: Run tests after each subtask completion to ensure nothing breaks
